# YouTube Audio Streamer

A lightweight Flask application that streams audio (MP3) from the most recent uploaded video of selected YouTube channels using `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`.

Perfect for low-bandwidth audio access to YouTube content â€” especially useful for older devices (like Symbian phones with CorePlayer) or embedded systems.

### Features

- Streams audio from the latest uploaded video (not live)
- Transcodes audio to MP3 (mono, 40 kbps) using `ffmpeg`
- Automatically refreshes every 30 minutes
- Simple route pattern: `/channel_name.mp3`
- Optimized for older phones and minimal media players

### Example Use

If you define a channel like:

```python
CHANNELS = {
    "skicr": "https://www.youtube.com/@skicrtv/videos"
}

You can stream it from:

http://your-server/skicr.mp3

This returns the MP3 stream of the most recently uploaded video from that channel.
